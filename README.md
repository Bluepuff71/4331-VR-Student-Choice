# Valve Index Controllers (Knuckles)
## Overview
The controllers for the Valve Index (also known as “knuckles”) are a set of finger tracking, grip-less controllers developed by Valve Software alongside their VR headset, the Valve Index.

Because they are built to support SteamVR, they work natively with any HMD that supports SteamVR.
## Where are they used?
The knuckles are designed to be used in every aspect of VR. This is acknowledged by valve themselves in the Knuckles patent, “[VR] systems are an application of great contemporary interest and rapid technical advancement, both within and outside of the video game industry. The controllers for VR systems have to perform several different functions, and meet strict (and sometimes competing) design constraints, often while optimizing certain desired characteristics like ease of use, etc.”

The effect of this acknowledgement can be seen across the entirety of the knuckles. From the form, to the function.
## The Basics
The knuckles use 87 sensors to track hand position, finger position, motion, and pressure. Combined with the grip-less design, this allows the controller to track individual fingers while also perfectly replicating natural interactions like grasping, throwing, and squeezing.
## Why is it a good use of VR?
The more we can accurately replicate natural interaction, the more use VR will have as both an entertainment medium and a simulation medium.
## Why is it unique?
There is no controller on the market like the Knuckles. The Knuckles take everything that is great about a VR glove and combine it with the best parts of a VR controller.
## Weaknesses
What makes the Knuckles unique is also the source of their problems. To be both a controller and a glove, the Knuckles had to make a compromise on the buttons and joysticks. The buttons and joysticks on the Knuckles are not comfortable to use.
## Hand Strain
Another major focus for the Knuckles was long-term comfort. With other controllers, you are unable to relax your hand while in VR without dropping the controller. This can lead to hand strain, an extremely common side effect of using VR for too long. Because the Knuckles are worn instead of held, users can relax their hands an any time, just like in real-life.
## Similar Applications
The Oculus Touch is another hand-tracking controller that falls short of the knuckles by not allowing the user to fully release the controller. This makes the finger tracking feel less natural and is therefore less user friendly.
## Potential Applications
As Valve put it in their patent for the Knuckles “[VR Hardware] have applicability outside of the video game industry, such as for controllers of industrial machines, defense systems, robotics, etc.” Furthermore, because the Knuckles allow for long-term VR comfort, I feel that they are the perfect candidate for any application.
## Conclusion
The more we continue to create technologies that allow for more natural VR interaction the more VR will be applicable to every industry. The world is a rapidly changing place. In two months, people went from face-to-face to online meetings. Maybe VR is the next step for face-to-face interaction? The fact that this question is even asked proves that devices like the Knuckles are a major step for VR and humanity.
